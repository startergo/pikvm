## Required parts

There are many different options with sub-items, so you can choose what is right for you.
However, we marked the recommended item by sign ✮ ✮ ✮


* **Raspberry Pi board**:
    * **✮ ✮ ✮ [Raspberry Pi 4 2Gb](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)**.<br>
      *It makes no sense to buy a Pi 4 with more memory than 2Gb, since PiKVM software uses very few resources.*
    * [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/).<br>
      *Compact and cheap, but not so reliable solution because of lack of the wired Ethernet.*

* **MicroSD card minimum 16Gb class 10**.

* **Video capture device**:
    * **✮ ✮ ✮ [HDMI-CSI bridge based on TC358743 chip](https://www.amazon.de/Waveshare-Raspberry-Supports-Backward-Compatible/dp/B092HVP926/)**.<br>
      *Supports H.264 video encoding, automatic resolution selection and the lowest possible latency*
    * [HDMI-USB dongle](https://www.amazon.com/Capture-Streaming-Broadcasting-Conference-Teaching/dp/B09FLN63B3).<br>
      *Only heavy MJPEG video, no resolution detection, big latency compared to HDMI-CSI.
      Some users report hardware problems: the dongle may not work in the BIOS or simply stop working after a while.
      It's a black box, and no one knows what's inside it. If you have problems with it, it will not be possible to fix them.*

* **Board-specific: Power supply, USB connectivity, etc.**

    ??? note "Only for Raspberry Pi 4"

        On a Raspberry Pi 4 only the USB port that receives power is capable of acting as a USB Device.
        The other USB ports are capable only of acting as USB Hosts.
        Therefore a special cable must be used on the USB power port that it can simultanously act as USB Device
        for the target host and receive external power from an power supply.

        ??? success "✮ ✮ ✮ Variant #1: Power supply + ready-made Y-splitter cable"

            * *x1* USB-C/Power Splitter Module ([US](https://www.pishop.us/product/usb-c-pwr-splitter/)/[UK](https://www.tindie.com/products/8086net/usb-cpwr-splitter)/[CA](https://www.buyapi.ca/product/usb-c-pwr-splitter/)).
            * *x1* USB-C to USB-C cable (male-male) for connecting the Raspberry Pi to the splitter.
            * *x1* USB-A to USB-C cable (male-male) for connecting the target host to the splitter.
            * *x1* [Official USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/).

        ??? tip "Variant #2: Power supply + Y-splitter based on power blocker"

            * *x1* USB-A to USB-A cable (male-male).
            * *x1* [USB splitter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C5FWQND).
            * *x1* [USB Power Blocker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B092MLT2J3) - Will go into the USB-A end towards the target host.
            * *x1* [Official USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/).

        ??? tip "Variant #3: Power supply + DIY Y-splitter for soldering"

            * *x1* USB-A to USB-C cable (male-male).
            * *x1* Another cable USB-A to *any* (male-*any*).
            * *x1* Any 5V 3A power supply with USB-A socket.

    ??? note "Only for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W"

        * *x1* USB-A to Usb-Micro cable (male-male).
        * *x1* [Raspberry Pi Zero Camera Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Arducam-Raspberry-Camera-Ribbon-Extension/dp/B085RW9K13). *Not compatible with Auvidea B101*.
        * *x1* [Official USB-Micro Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/Capture-Streaming-Broadcasting-Conference-Teaching/dp/B09FLN63B3).

* **Option: ATX management (control the target power)**

    * *x4* [MOSFET relays OMRON G3VM-61A1](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=G3VM-61A1).<br>
      *Don't use random relay modules or random optocouplers! Some relays or optocouplers may not be sensitive enough for the Raspberry Pi, some others may be low-level controlled. Either use relays that are activated by a high logic level, or follow the design provided and buy an OMRON. See details [here](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/issues/13).*
    * *x4* 390 Ohm resistors (see [here](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/issues/46) for alternatives).
    * *2x* 4.7 kOhm resistors.
    * A breadboard and wires.

* **Option: VGA video capture**

    If you want to capture VGA from your server instead of HDMI, buy the [VGA-to-HDMI converter](https://aliexpress.com/item/3256801728005613.html).
    Some converters have issues with not supporting all resolutions and refresh rates.


*Kit parts suitable for assembly are also on [sale in Poland](https://3mdeb.com/shop/open-source-hardware/pikvm/)*
